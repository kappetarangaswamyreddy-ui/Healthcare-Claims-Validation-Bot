# 🏥 Healthcare Claims Validation Bot  
### End-to-End Automation Using UiPath Document Understanding, Regex Extraction, Business Rules & Action Center  
**Author:** Ranga Swamy Reddy (Ranga Kappeta)

## 📌 Project Overview

In the healthcare domain, validating claim PDFs is a repetitive and error-prone activity.  
Many claims contain missing fields, invalid NPI numbers, incorrect ICD-10 codes, mismatched totals, or inconsistent service dates.  

To replicate a real-world healthcare automation scenario, I built this **Healthcare Claims Validation Bot** using:

- **UiPath Document Understanding (DU)**  
- **Regex Extractor**  
- **Custom business rule validation engine**  
- **Action Center (Human-in-the-loop)**  
- **Excel automation**

The goal of this bot is to:
1. Automatically extract claim data from PDF files  
2. Validate fields using strict healthcare business rules  
3. Separate valid vs invalid claims  
4. Automatically send invalid claims to **UiPath Action Center**  
5. Allow a human to review & approve/fix the claim  
6. Produce clean output files for downstream processing  

This project demonstrates how an RPA Engineer uses DU + business rules + Action Center to build intelligent automations.

## 🎯 Project Objectives (My Focus Areas)

### ✔ Build a real-time DU extraction workflow  
### ✔ Implement strict validation rules like a healthcare backend system  
### ✔ Integrate Action Center for human review  
### ✔ Produce clean audit files for compliance teams  
### ✔ Understand the full lifecycle: PDFs → Extraction → Validation → Human Review → Excel Output  

This project helped me practice how real enterprise healthcare automation works.

# 🧠 **Key Features (Explained in My Point of View)**

## 1️⃣ Document Understanding Pipeline

I designed a complete DU flow:
Digitize Document → Load Taxonomy → Data Extraction Scope → Regex Based Extractor

### DU handles:
- Claim ID  
- Member ID  
- Patient Name  
- Provider Name  
- Provider NPI  
- Service Dates  
- CPT/HCPCS Code  
- ICD-10 Code  
- Units  
- Line Amount  
- Total Amount  

The extraction is driven by a custom **Taxonomy.json** (included in repo).

### Why DU?
Because healthcare PDFs come in different formats.  
DU + Regex gives accurate, structured extraction even from scanned PDFs.

## 2️⃣ Business Rule Validation Engine

After extraction, I created a validation block that applies healthcare rules such as:

### ✔ NPI Format Check  
Must be exactly 10 digits

### ✔ ICD-10 Format Check  
[A-Z][0-9][0-9][A-Z0-9]{0,4}

### ✔ Required Field Check  
- Claim ID  
- Member ID  
- Provider NPI  
- Total Amount  
- Service Dates  

### ✔ Date Range Check  
ServiceDateFrom ≤ ServiceDateTo

### ✔ Amount Check  
Sum of line-level charges must equal header TotalChargeAmount.

### ✔ Error Aggregation  
If any rule fails → all messages are collected into `ErrorMessages`.

This creates an audit trail that healthcare payers and compliance teams expect.

## 3️⃣ Action Center Human Review

For every invalid claim:

- A **Form Task** is created
- The form automatically displays:
  - Claim ID (read-only)
  - Error Messages (read-only)
  - Provider NPI
  - Resolution (Approve / Fix & Resubmit / Reject)
  - Reviewer Comments

### Why Action Center?  
Healthcare claims require **human review** when rules fail.  
Rather than rejecting automatically, I give the reviewer a chance to approve or correct.

---

## 4️⃣ Excel Output Generation

The bot produces two files:
Output/
│── ValidClaims.xlsx → Clean, validated claims
│── ErrorClaims.xlsx → Invalid claims before human review
These files give a clear comparison of:

- What passed
- What failed
- Why it failed (detailed error messages)

---

# 🏗️ Workflow Logic (Step-by-Step)

### 1. Load Config.xlsx  
Reads input/output folder paths.

### 2. Load Taxonomy.json  
Defines claim structure for DU.

### 3. Loop through PDFs  
Each file is processed one by one.

### 4. Extract Data using DU  
Header + Line items extracted with Regex.

### 5. Validate data  
If valid → add to dtValid  
If invalid → add to dtError + create Action Center task

### 6. Generate Excel outputs  
Using Workbook Write Range (stable & fast).

### 7. Action Center Step  
Human reviews the invalid claim.

### 8. End of workflow  
Bot finishes cleanly.

# 🔮 Future Enhancements (My Plan)

- Add ML-based metadata classification  
- Use Intelligent Keyword Classifier  
- Push lookup validation from SQL database  
- Integrate with FHIR/HL7  
- Build dashboards in Power BI  
- Add automatic claim fixing suggestions
